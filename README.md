Zeolites are microporous materials whose performance is governed by their pore structures. This method simplifies complex pore channels into "node-link" networks, capturing both connectivity and global topological characteristics of accessible pores. It enables efficient pore matching and rapid screening of candidate zeolites from massive structure databases.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into functional directories, with the following descriptions for each folder:

- ToposPro/: Used to process output files generated by the ToposPro software.

- MaterialsStudio/: Contains a series of scripts for calling MaterialsStudio software to perform file processing tasks.

- PoreTopology/: Includes content related to pore channel analysis, supporting the core pore topology research work.
